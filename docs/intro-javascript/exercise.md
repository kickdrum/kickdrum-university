# Exercise

Look into the `/javascript` folder of the Github Repository you just created. Open it using VS Code or any other editor of your choice.

Run this command to install necessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

Open the `index.html` files in the `/calculator` and `/counter` folders. Read the question in comment and implement it.

A hot-reload server is included by default for you to see your changes live as you save

```bash
npm start:calc #To see your calculator site in action
npm start:count #To see your counter site in action
```
Run these individually while working on your questions.
This serves your app on a `localhost` URL which you can visit and see your website.

Feel free to checkout the `/cypress/e2e/app-tests.cy.js` file to know exactly what sort of test-cases have been written and adapt your program to succeed.
