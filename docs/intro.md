# Intro

Let's set you up **it should take 25 minutes (depends on your machine and internet ðŸ˜‰)**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a Github Account first**.

If you have it setup already, **AWESOMEðŸ¤©**.

### What you'll need (tools and tech)

- [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) version 21 or above
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Everyone's favourite code editor ?
- [Intellij IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) No better IDE for Java.
  [Detailed Installation instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Because there's no better tool for collaborating on code

## Checks before launch

Check Node JS and NPM Package manager

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Check Java

```bash
java --version
```

Check Git

```bash
git --version
```

If all of these return version numbers, Houston is ready for launch !

:::info For Nerds
If you are already familiar with all of these tools, Great!
Feel free to use any other tools that enhance your Dev Experience on top of these tools
for example - Gitlens (a better Git flow right in VS Code), nvm (manage multiple Node Versions) etc.
For terminal enthusiasts - you can explore [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
<br />
**All of these are optional** and not needed for you to excel in Pre-KDU or KDU by any means. You'll find these across the docs for reference.
