# Exercise

Look into the `/html_css` folder of the Github Repository you just created. Open it using VS Code or any other editor of your choice.

Run this command to install necessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

Open the `index.html`. The question is added as a comment. Use your creativity make a beautiful website. Add as much CSS as you want.

A hot-reload server is included by default for you to see your changes live as you save

```bash
npm start
```

This serves your app on a `localhost` URL which you can visit and see your website.
