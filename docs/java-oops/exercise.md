Look into the `/java_oops` folder of the Github Repository you just created. Open it using VS Code/Intellij or any other editor of your choice.

Open the `App.java` program and read the question properly. Implement the necessary classes and functions.

You can add new classes in separate files to make the code more modular.

Feel free to checkout the test file to know exactly what sort of test-cases have been written and adapt your program to succeed.
