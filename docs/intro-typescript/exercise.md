# Exercise

Look into the `/typescript` folder of the Github Repository you just created. Open it using VS Code or any other editor of your choice.

Run this command to install necessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

Open the `q*.ts` files. Read the question in comment and implement it.

You can test the output of your code in the console by running

```bash
npm run tsc q1.ts #You can run any question file
```

Run these individually while working on your questions.

:::tip
Feel free to checkout the `.test.ts` file to know exactly what sort of test-cases have been written and adapt your program to succeed.
